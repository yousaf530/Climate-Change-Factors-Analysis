Data Analysis and Visualization of Climate Change Factors using Power BI

## Problem Statement

Climate change has been a very big issue in developing countries like Pakistan due to a number of different factor. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. When burnt, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide into the air, causing the planet to heat up.

## Our Story

Our story starts from 1991 where the total population of Pakistan was around 111 million and goes to 2015 where it the population jumped 199 million after 80.02 % increase. Correlated to that, the Urban Population jumps to an even higher of 110.39 % increase showing many people shifted from rural to Urban Areas due to industrialization and increased opportunities.

With the increase in the Urban population and industrialization, we see a decline in the Forest Land Area in Pakistan with passing years from 3.22% to 1.91%, which shows that deforestation was carried out to accommodate such a large increase in Urban population and cities had to outgrow their limits and acquire the surrounding land for development of industries.

With the advancement in Urban cities and increase development processes and industrial plantation in the Urban areas, the emission of CO2, carbon related, and other harmful gases were seen to rise to a very alarming level showing 176% increase from 1991. This caused the temperature and precipitation patterns to vary up to a very large extent showing severe climate conditions such as droughts, floods, global warming and much more.

Government should make proper policies to limit the use of fossil fuels and plant as much green trees as possible to fight this drastic change and make the future climate conditions better for living beings.
